when you inspect the requst payload note that it is a json object containig a password key 
 when you provide an array containing all the provided passwords and send a request with this payload you will get a 302 response code meaning that this is the logic flaw 
    we have been looking for (the server side code possibly iterates over the password value insted of reading directly the value )
    after finding about this you can perform a binary seach over the list by elemenating the half of it until you find the correct passowrd!!
